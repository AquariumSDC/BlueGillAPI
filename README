## Test Analysis and Results

### GOAL - Review Benchmark takeaways, research and prescribe potential solution, and measure results

ANALYSIS - High CPU usage is an indicative cause for reduced backend RPS performance. Scaling infrastructure to match needs is a viable solution to realign performance with target metrics.
To maintain cost-effectiveness, horizontal scaling will be explored before vertical scaling. Will additionally add redundancy to service.
